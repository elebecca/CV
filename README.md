## Skills

My skills are mainly focused in graphics design. However, I found out that coding is an endless source to release my inner creativity and problem-solving skills.

#### Another Skill

- Creative - I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving and try to look things with a different point of you.
- Adapt to changing environments - The biggest change was for me movine on one other country. A new culture, new language 
- with a different way to work.
- Organization and time managing - I worked many years like freelance it was necessary know how to manage the time and
  be able to focus in the priorities when there is a deadline.
- Multitasking - my job brought me to work often at more than one task at the time.
