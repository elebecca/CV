## About
I am a passionate developer with a strong background in graphic design. I'm fascinated about the intersection of technology of creativity. I’ve  good communication skills, a can-do attitude and am always looking to go the extra mile. Recently I’ve been a graduate in Makers Academy (London's leading programming bootcamp) in order to become upskilled with best practice tools and methodologies.
I like to stay up to date with the latest frameworks and programming techniques.


## Projects

Whilst studying at Makers Academy I have fundamentally 'learnt how to learn' new technologies through pair programming, OO, TDD and XP principles. For a complete list of my projects, see my [Github](https://github.com/elebecca).
